> HealthNow has been part of Virtual Clinical Solutions officially since 2019. I was the product designer taking care of the mobile apps to the supporting web app and the store assets that included the logos, the communique messages that were dispatched through the product.

# Design System

I revered engineered and designed a design system for HealthNow based on the current state of the product and then proceed to revamp the designs. There were huge constraints to work with, right from finance till market pressure to deliver the features soon.

# Product Interface

The product is built on Xamarin and is available for Android and iOS mobile platform. Producing the high-fidelity visual designs; a friendly and seamless experience.

# Process

We have several touchpoints of data analytics to work while designing the HealthNow product. We processed the raw data, picked the themes coming out and started to construct a story with the workflow. Some of these stories identified the problems with the current system and some of them showed potentials to create new value.

We then approached the visual design with prototyping the screens. We validated the problem statement by different means including user testing, concept inquiries and data analysis. Identifying the right method to validate the problem was a collective decision involving the product team. Once we picked the right hypothesis, we then approached the visual design of the components to further iterate the flows, screens and the interaction using the click through on the phone.

# What did I learn?

- Reverse engineering a design system for an existing mobile application helps identify the experience problems that could be easily tied back to basic laws of UX.
- Creating a design critique culture within the product team to identify and capitalize on product feedback improved our feedback cycle timings.
- Selecting a right sample size with user testing was always important, since the sample size sometimes may not represent the actual market feedback and improving on the test suite for the product is a progressive challenge.
