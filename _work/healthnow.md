> HealthNow has been part of Virtual Clinical Solutions officially since 2019. I was the product designer taking care of the mobile apps that enable access to medical appointments, connects to the Australian Government's My Health Record and useful in finding hospitals and other healthcare services.

## Design System

When I started with the designer on this product, the mobile apps lacked a design system and I reverse-engineered and designed one for HealthNow based on the current state of the product and then proceeded to revamp the designs. The initial abstract from the analysis enabled us to take stock of the components that were inconsistent in usage. These inconsistencies were then an easy fix when driving updates through a design system. There were gaps to work within the apps in terms of indifferent controls representing actions, updating these required workflow mapping, and understanding the user journey. Once we were able to get that information sorted and validated, then it gave us the confidence to patch our updates through the design system. Once the design system was in place, we were able to scale the feature updates quickly with a short turnaround time for high-fidelity screen designs and iterations.

## Product Interface

The product is built on Xamarin and is available for Android and iOS mobile platforms. As a design team, we constantly worked on several iterations to produce high-fidelity visual designs through design critique sessions and user testing and feedback iterations; to produce a friendly and seamless experience.

## Process

We identified several touchpoints of user analytics to work with while designing the HealthNow product. We processed the raw data, identified recurring and opportunistic themes, and started to construct a story with the workflows. Some of these stories identified the problems with the current product and some of them showed potentials to create new value.

We then approached the visual design by prototyping the screens. We validated the solution by different means including user testing, concept inquiries, and user analytics. Identifying the right method to validate the problem was a collective decision involving the product team and once we settled on the right hypothesis, we then further iterated the high fidelity design of the components to accommodate the workflows, screens, and interactions using the click-through design prototype on the phones.

## What did I learn?

- Reverse engineering a design system for an existing mobile app helped identify the experience problems that could be easily tied back to the basic laws of UX.
- Creating a design critique culture within the product release cycle to identify and capitalize on feedback scaled our value delivery.
- Selecting the right sample size with user testing was always important since the sample size sometimes may not represent the actual user feedback and improving on the test suite for the product is a progressive challenge.
