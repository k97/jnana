> HealthNow has been part of Virtual Clinical Solutions officially since 2019. I was the product designer taking care of the mobile apps to the supporting web app and the store assets that included the logos, the communique messages that were dispatched through the product.

## Design System

The mobile apps lacked a design system and I reverse-engineered and designed one for HealthNow based on the current state of the product and then proceeded to revamp the designs. The initial abstract from the analysis enabled us to take stock of the components that were inconsistent in usage. These inconsistencies were then an easy fix when driving updates through a design system. There were gaps to work within the apps in terms of indifferent controls representing actions, updating these required workflow mapping, and understanding the user journey. Once we were able to get that information sorted and validated, then it gave us the confidence to patch our updates through the design system. Once the design system was in place, we were able to scale the feature updates quickly with a short turnaround time for high-fidelity screen designs and iterations.

## Product Interface

The product is built on Xamarin and is available for Android and iOS mobile platforms. Producing high-fidelity visual designs; a friendly and seamless experience.

## Process

We have several touchpoints of data analytics to work with while designing the HealthNow product. We processed the raw data, picked the themes, and started to construct a story with the workflow. Some of these stories identified the problems with the current system and some of them showed potentials to create new value.

We then approached the visual design by prototyping the screens. We validated the problem statement by different means including user testing, concept inquiries, and data analysis. Identifying the right method to validate the problem was a collective decision involving the product team. Once we picked the right hypothesis, we then approached the visual design of the components to further iterate the flows, screens, and interactions using the click-through on the phone.

## What did I learn?

- Reverse engineering a design system for an existing mobile app helped identify the experience problems that could be easily tied back to the basic laws of UX.
- Creating a design critique culture within the product team to identify and capitalize on product feedback scaled our iteration cycle.
- Selecting the right sample size with user testing was always important since the sample size sometimes may not represent the actual market feedback and improving on the test suite for the product is a progressive challenge.
