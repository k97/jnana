> My goal at FastTrack360 as a Product Designer was to work on the overall improvement of user experience and create new ways to handle forms so that the time spent on capturing information is optimized with minimal errors. I also worked in close collaboration with the engineering team to building the document editor and setting up the design system.

## Design process

The FastTrack360 Back Office product was built on a legacy Microsoft Silverlight solution. We along with a product team were responsible for redesigning the product workflow into a cloud-based web product. I was responsible for the new workflows and we started with product research and synthesis. The features were mapped into a different deliverable module, which could then be user tested through the customer-engagement team, and the feedback cycle was established within the product releases. We also set up user analytics to track behavioral workflows and consolidated all this data to identify and work on possible business opportunities within the product.

As the lead product designer, I engaged with the business stakeholders and the product service team to set up a new design system to scale the new features across the product with a quicker feedback loop. The design system initiated was purely a team effort to consolidate the existing micro-components across the product and establish a generalized interface and delivering a seamless end-user experience. Several product concepts were designed and iterated to progress the conversation and deliver these enhanced user experiences.

## Editor

The document editor was the interface for users to view, edit and share document templates for all billing and payment receipts and forms. The Editor is the most complex, with several parts to it with an easy drag and drop interface. There is also a version history, information configurator, permissions configurator, image publishing UI, and so on.
