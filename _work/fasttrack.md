> My goal at FastTrack360 as a Product Designer, was to work on overall improvement of user experience and create new ways to handle forms so that the time spent on capturing information is optimised with minimal errors. I also worked in close collaboration with engineering team to building the document editor and setting up the design system.

## Design process

I engaged with the business stakeholders and the product service team to establish a feedback loop for the new features. We setup multiple sessions with the end-users to gorilla test the features and review the iterations. I setup analytics for user behavioural tracking and we consolidated all this data to identify and work on possible business opportunities within the product.

## Editor

The document editor was the interface for users to view, edit and share document templates for all billing and payment receipts and forms. The Editor is the most complex, with several parts to it with an easy drag and drop interface. There is also a version history, information configurator, permissions configurator, image publishing UI, and so on.
