CricHQ is a scoring platform automated the process of scoring and organizing cricketing tournaments. I worked with CricHQ as an interface designer for the mobile apps and worked with the engineering team on the web app.

## Design workflow

Product KPIs were set by the stakeholders and as product team we collectively worked on picking the product opportunities and set out to deliver. The designs kicked off from paper sketches to a low-fidelity prototypes after each iteration involving different user validations, we then proceeded to do high-fidelity designs. Designing for the mobile apps was hard challenge since the feature release cycles were different for each platforms of Android and iOS. I worked closely with the PMs to prioritise design iterations for each platforms, while also working on the designs of the web application.

## Interfaces

The product modules were a combination of social, competition, live matches and team management. The web app worked as backend for the mobile apps in a typical user workflows and I worked closely with the engineering team on optimising the enduser experience.

## What did I learn?

1. I introduced BEM methodologies into the web app style management and extensively worked on asset delivery mechanisms to optimise page load experience.
2. Designing for different platforms simultaneously allowed me to establish a common experience with social workflows of the platform,
