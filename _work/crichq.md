CricHQ is a more of a platform than an app which automated the manual process of scoring and organizing cricketing events at any scale and level. The initial user touch-point starts with the web app, where the user schedules and organizes a tournament and then each of the scheduled matches are scored from within the mobile apps.

### Role

I was involved in the front-end development of the admin application, design of mobile app screens and the marketing website.

### Design

The designs were roughly translated from paper sketches to a low-fidelity prototypes after each iteration involving different users. I used tools like Balsamiq for prototyping and photoshop for the high-fidelity mocks. Designing for mobile screen mostly involved strategizing the asset delivery adhering to the each platform\u2019s interface guidelines.

### Development

The webapp admin module was developed using [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/), [MarionetteJS](https://marionettejs.com/) and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) as the major frameworks and Rails as the backend which delivered REST services. Each sprint was different since I got to work across a range of modules: social, competition, live matches and the marketing website design and development.

The main challenges we faced during the development of the webapp were on the maintenance and reusability aspects. We used SCSS for styles development and broke down the scripts into multiple view layers to promote reusability of the components at large scale.
