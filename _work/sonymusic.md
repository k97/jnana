The Sony music royalty app was used by music producers and creators to manage their project contracts and track their earning across the globe.
The project was conceived as finance management app with a geolocation based feature support to engage audience from different European countries, Germany, Spain, France and United Kingdom.

### The Concept

I was responsible for the design of the interfaces and I started off with understanding the current app, info structure and the workflows. I mapped out the findings into running document and then started to engage with the team managing finance algorithm of the product and the business stakeholders with different design concepts. Since the royalty agreements where unique to every single artist on the platform, generalising the user-flow was a hard problem to solve. We ideated different hypothesis and picked an sample size of different years of engagement as the driving factor to work on the user-flows.

### User Interface

I later synthesised these design iterations and broke down the features set with the engineering and the stakeholder team members to identify release candidates. Each release candidates were then iterated with different mock data and user validations in the form of geolocation testing and localisation inputs. Once the designs were then validated, I worked with the engineering team to develop the release candidates to accomodate the multi-device support in terms of responsive interfaces and performance optimisations to deliver a seamless experience.

### What I learnt?

- Multilingual support involving different languages was a hard problem to solve when working with mutli-device support.
- Geolocation features took us multiple iteration to provide a seamless experience with application.
- Currency conversion between different locations was a hard problem to solve and presenting values in decimal precision was important to the users, which we then improved through user validation sessions.
