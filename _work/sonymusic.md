> The Sony music royalty app was used by music producers and creators to manage their project contracts and track their earnings across the globe. The project was conceived as a finance management app with geolocation-based features to engage the audience from different European countries, Germany, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

## The Concept

I was responsible for the design of the interfaces and I started with understanding the current app, info architecture, product map, and workflows. I mapped out the findings into a running document and then started to engage with the team managing the finance team of the product and the stakeholders with different design concepts. Since the royalty agreements were unique to every single artist on the platform, generalizing the user flow was a hard problem to solve. We ideated different hypotheses and picked a sample size of different years of engagement as the driving factor to work on the user flows.

## User Interface

I later synthesized these design iterations and broke down the features set with the engineering and the stakeholder team members to identify release candidates. Each release's candidates were then iterated with different mock data and user validations in the form of geolocation testing and localization inputs. Once the designs were then validated, I worked with the engineering team to develop the release candidates to accommodate the multi-device support in terms of responsive interfaces and performance optimizations to deliver a seamless experience.

## What did I learn?

- Multilingual support involving different languages was a hard problem to solve when working with multi-device support.
- Geolocation features took us multiple iterations to provide a seamless experience with the application.
- Currency conversion between different locations was a hard problem to solve and presenting values in decimal precision was important to the users, which we then improved through user validation sessions.
