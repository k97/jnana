> Telstra Health’s Virtual Health service offering is powered by a suite of products that are used by patients and healthcare providers. I helped identify the touchpoints and designed a few of these products that delivers value through the virtual health experience: from patient onboarding all the way till service delivery.

# The Design Team

As the lead designer, or senior designer if you will, my role has evolved over time as we’ve expanded our design team at Virtual Clinical Solutions. We worked through the product aspects in our adapted version of the design sprint and delivered these iterated features through a development sprint. The working model is very close to a functional double-diamond with our own interpretation of the intersection with product test & validation strategies.

## Concept & development

We discussed the vision of the product and the value creation in multiple workshops involving the stakeholders, endusers and the vendors at times. This helped us identify the features and functionalities in the product. I, then started with a straightforward concept design, and documentation to visualise the functional components. These concepts later empowered the group to have meaningful discussions around the future state of the product.

# User Interface

Once we mapped out the data and started to construct themes for the product, we then proceeded to workout few different hypothesis to create a story and then proceeded to validate these stories through screens and flows. The validation methods varies from clinical testing, workflow inquiries with clinical staff. We collected data in simple formats to validate our findings and initial assumptions. With this information, I also continued to focus on the product evolution on how each feature will be presented in the right context.

# Development

Large part of my time was spent on product development, leading the design of the interfaces and figuring out what we should build and how we should design it.

## Design system

Telstra Health’s larger design team founded a design system and I continued to contribute to it, in addition to leading the design of Virtual Clinical Solutions. It was truly a team effort! So many people at Telstra Health contributed through different means and helped build the design system, internally called “DNA”.

## Component

Apart from the micro components from the DNA design system, I formulated a repository of product-components which was most impactful with our design deliverables. The learnings from designing these components were then translated to engineering a component in the React code with the team. We achieved this through several design-handover sessions and iterations.

# Delivery

The feature transition from design to development and then planning out an end-to-end workflow gave us confidence with our solution for the products. After hours of development and testing by the team we were able to release these products eventually and see it perform in the market through feedback and analytics.

# What did I learn?

There were several challenges during the design phase of these products:

- Identifying clinical risk and planning the designs based on risk evaluation wasn’t always straight forward and breaking down the design specs to a very simpler form helped us call out several assumptions which otherwise would have been unnoticed.
- Designing a product experience that could understood by clinicians & common people and delivering value beyond the product touchpoints.
- Most important aspect that I could abstract away from working with Telstra Health was the medical IT it is ripe for disruption. Product opportunities would always continue to exist in any workflows where efficiency could be achieved, but integration between these products is an arduous problem to solve and design plays a key role in delivering truly an integrated experience.
