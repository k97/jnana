I'm doing yet another iteration on my website. Unlike the previous versions, I want the next one to hold for a longer timespan. In the coming weeks, I will be logging the process here, so it can stay as a reference material.
The other day I was browsing through some content on the web through a reasonably large screenspace and I encountered a program. The program had instructed me to complete a set of tasks or rather some interesting questions. For context, let us assume it was an online quiz. Therefore it's obvious that the system might trick me in certain questions. One of the questions was about the side, LHS vs RHS. An elementary detail, but if done in a frivolous way, could potentially cause some detrimental effects.

The mobile apps, particularly the maps instruct the user from the users perspective but a trivial problem such as this has big impact on the user. Imagine a scenario were the user is navigating a maze of streets. If the right and the left sides were mixed up, this would lead to the user straying away from this destination. Tricking a user intentionally is a different subject altogether but when designing an app, considering the user perspective is really important than anything else.

Sometimes, these bugs slip through the process and the user maybe find it. I encountered one such scenario and in the end I got my answers wrong because its was a 50-50 chance that I couldnâ€™t understand where the system was directing. Its such a minor detail which may have slipped through engineering but these little big details make up the experience for the end-user.
